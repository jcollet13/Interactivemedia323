			<p>In the desert</p>
			<p>I saw a creature, naked, bestial,</p>
			<p>Who, squatting upon the ground,</p>
			<p>held his heart in his hands,</p>
			<p>And ate of it.</p>
			<p>I said, Is it good friend?</p>
			<p>It is bitter bitter, he answered;</p>
			<p>But I like it</p>
			<p>Because it is bitter,</p>
			<p>And because it is my heart.</p>
